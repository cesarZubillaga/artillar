# Artillar

This website tester it is prepared for checking the behaviour of your website returning multiple values such as.

  - Latency (min,max,median,p95,p99)
  - HTTP ERRORS
  
Those values are displayed with two types of graphics (bars and radar) and a table, and you can add/delete those graphics with simple interface.

### Tech

Artillar uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [GulpLivereload] - for developing enviroment.
* [Artillery] - Node testing ToolKit
* [AngularChartJS] - Beautifull charts
* [Livereload Extension] - For developing purposes

### Installation

You need to have NODE and BOWER installed. For dev purpouses you need GULP but no mandatory.

```sh
$ npm install
$ bower install
```
### Runing tests
There's a sample test on the Runnable Tests to check out.

### TODOs!
  - Data from the sever.
  - Display the rest of the data available thanks to [Artillery] reports.
